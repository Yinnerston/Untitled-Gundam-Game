# Language Features and Quirks

### What Questions do I have

The use of classes with the `I` prefix such as `IClassName`?

What is the async model in c#? Any quirks I need to know?

Decorators in c#?

Attributes: `[DataAttribute]` syntax using a annotation enclosed in `[` and `]` square brackets
- E.G. `[SerializeField]` exposes the serializable field in the Unity Editor? 
- Used to associate metadata or declarative information with code.

using statement --> Disposes of context after statement has completed execution
- We use this when seeding our first data data models in our web application. 
- Where would this feature be useful?
