# Human Computer Interaction

Textbook: Interaction Design beyond human-computer interaction 6th Edition

What is **People-Centered Design**?
- Focus on the needs of "people". Envision exactly the kind of person who is using the application and HOW they are using it
- Design for human communication and interaction
- The experience when using the product is also key, in addition to the performance
- Accessibility and inclusivitiy

Principles i may follow
- Simple is better and more elegant
- Digital products: No wait, remembers your preferences, easy access, digital records
- Products need to provide fedback about what has previously been done so the user knows what to do next
- Findability : Is it easy to discover the feature you want?
- Navigability : Is it obvious what to do and where to go?
- visibility : How the interface is designed to show what someone needs to do next 
- feedback : Sending back information to communicate the result of a user's actions
- constraints : Restrict the kinds of user interaction (e.g. by greying out disabled menus)
- consistency : Similar design elements for similar tasks
- affordance : Attributes of an object that let know you how to use it (e.g. you know to turn doorknobs)

What do you need to consider when designing a product?
- Effectiveness
- Efficiency
- Safety
- Utility : The extent the product provides the right kind of functionbality (e.g. additional tools)
- Learnability : How easy is the product to learn (can you learn it without a guide?)
- Memorability : E.g. Using sequences of icons and verbose names to improve continued use
- Satisfaction : Attention, pace, play, interactivity, conscious / unconscious control, narrative and flow.

What do UX designers do?
- User researcher: Collect and analyse user data to create a low fidelity prototype
- Usability analyst: Test the prototype
- Information architect: Plan user experience building wireframes
- Interaction designer: Design interactive elements like buttons
- Visual designer: Designs the look, feel, theme, graphical elements, etc.
- UX design: Jack of all trades

Conceptual Models: You need to consider the user's mental model of the application
- E.G. Conventions such as a home button on a phone, swipe down to get settings
- Symbols are important: When you see a scissors icon, you think of cutting. When you see a brush icon, you think you can draw.
  - Mail envelopes, cameras, trolley, magnifying glass --> These are all metaphors using real world objects as digital actions
- Copying is flattery
