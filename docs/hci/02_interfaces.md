# Interfaces

Goals:
- Learn about the Diversity, Design and research considerations
- What is a natural user interface
- What interface is best for your application?

The default interface nowadays is probably a smartphone app to solve a user's problems.

### Types of Interfaces

- Command: Bash, Powershell, etc. You gotta love em'! 
  - Most important design principle is consistency. Such as using the first and last letters consistently, -args separated by spaces, etc
- Graphical: First WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers)
  - Windows: Scrollable, stretchable and overlapping boxes. They were invented to allow multitasking for users (instead of all commands on one commandline)
    - Problems with multiple windows?
      -  Mac shrinks them down when you press the index button so you can choose which one to open.
      -  Enlarge windows when they are hovered
   -  Dialogue boxes: Guide users through a sequence (e.g. think of installation wizards)
  - Icons: Pictograms representign apps, objects, commands, etc.
  - Menus: List of options --> Dropdowns, Toolbars, docks, etc
  - Pointing device: Mouse controlling the cursor
