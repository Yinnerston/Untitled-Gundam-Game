### How was C# created?

- Gates's Vision: Uncouple the language from the machine
- "First we shape of tools, then the tools shape us."
- Runtimes in the 90s:
- Libraries in the 90s:
- Base class libraries in the 90s:

### What is .NET?

- `.NET` is a platform 
  - C# / F# / VB is converted to a Compiled Intermediate Language (CIL)
  - Just-In-Time compiler converts CIL to machine code 
  - Language =/= Framework. Different versions of languages have different compatibilities with `.NET`.
- What does `.NET` solve?
  - "It's windows all the way down" --> Why do we care?
- `.NET Framework` stopped at 4.8
  - Abstraction layer that was replaced by `.NET Core` which is now called `.NET`
- Why was the `.NET Core` framework created --> Reinventing .NET
  - Compilation /workload began to take too long due to too much added to the framework
  - Uses a different abstraction layer but has the same intermediate compiled languages
  - Think of .net core as a different abstraction layer that compiles into the same intermediate language
:::tip Versions
Versions of `.NET Core` after 5 are simply called `.NET`
:::
- `.NET Standard` bridges the gap of ???
  - Xamarin
  - Mono
  - Unity
  - ^ Does it bridge all these into one abstraction layer?
- `.NET 6.0` collapses above abstraction layers into one ???

### What questions did I ask?

-  What is the history of platform independent code?
-  How does Java relate to .NET?
-  Are operating systems just part of the "plumbing" now?
   -  is this the idea of IaaS
-  Why was .NET invented?
   -  What problem was Just-in-time compilation solving?
   -  Why did it survive? Why is it still supported?
   -  Is .NET serverside or clientside?
   -  Does .NET support unity??
-  Why is javascript not compiled?
-  What is language parity? What is feature parity?
-  What is a modern services dev?
   -  WebAPI?
   -  Microservices?
-  Web developers are used to lousy tools...
   -  What are good tools?
-  What is XAML?
-  What is WCF?

### What questions did other people ask?

### What sounds interesting?
- Xamarin
- WebAPI vs these frameworks?
  - What do people mean when refering to web frameworks instead of frameworks like .NET ??
