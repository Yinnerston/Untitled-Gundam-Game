### What can I build with .NET Core?

![Example ASP.NET Architecture](imgs/aspnet_core_example_architecture.png)

Paradigms build on top of ASP.NET Core
- Minimal APIs—Simple HTTP APIs that can be consumed by mobile applications or browser-based single-page applications.
- Web APIs—An alternative approach to building HTTP APIs that adds more structure and features than minimal APIs.
- gRPC APIs—Used to build efficient binary APIs for server-to-server communication using the gRPC protocol.
- Razor Pages—Used to build page-based server-rendered applications.
- MVC controllers—Similar to Razor Pages. Model-View-Controller (MVC) controller applications are for server-based applications but without the page-based paradigm.
- Blazor WebAssembly—A browser-based single-page application framework that uses the WebAssembly standard, similar to JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue.
- Blazor Server—Used to build stateful applications, rendered on the server, that send UI events and page updates over WebSockets to provide the feel of a client-side single-page application but with the ease of development of a server-rendered application
